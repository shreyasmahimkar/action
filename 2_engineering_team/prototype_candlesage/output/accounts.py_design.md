# accounts.py Module Design

## Overview
The `accounts.py` module is designed to facilitate the backend logic required for a web application that provides statistical and technical analysis of stocks/cryptocurrencies. The module will provide mockup data for demonstration purposes and will have functionality to handle user actions like login, signup, and viewing analysis, forecasts, and news.

## Classes and Methods

### Class: `Account`
This class handles user-related activities such as login, signup, and loading user profile details.

#### Methods:
- `__init__(self, username: str = '', password: str = '')`
  - Constructs an Account object with optional username and password.
  
- `signup(self, username: str, password: str) -> dict`
  - Mock signup functionality that creates a user profile.
  - Returns a mock user profile dictionary.

- `login(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool`
  - Mock login function that checks credentials.
  - Returns True if credentials match the mock account (`testuser`, `testpassword`).

- `get_user_profile(self, username: str) -> dict`
  - Returns mock user profile details.

### Class: `StockAnalysis`
Handles data analysis for stocks and cryptocurrencies, including statistical and technical analysis.

#### Methods:
- `get_statistical_analysis(self, symbol: str) -> dict`
  - Returns a mock dictionary containing statistical analysis details.

- `get_technical_analysis(self, symbol: str) -> dict`
  - Returns a mock dictionary containing technical analysis details.

### Class: `News`
Fetches and handles news data for a given stock or cryptocurrency.

#### Methods:
- `get_news(self, symbol: str) -> list`
  - Returns a mock list of news articles for the given symbol.

### Class: `Forecast`
Handles time series forecasting for a stock or cryptocurrency.

#### Methods:
- `forecast_next_7_days(self, symbol: str) -> list`
  - Returns a mock list representing the forecasted prices for the next 7 days.

### Class: `MachineLearningModels`
Implements machine learning models to predict the next state of stocks/cryptocurrencies.

#### Methods:
- `predict_with_hmm(self, symbol: str) -> str`
  - Returns a mock prediction using a Hidden Markov Model.

- `predict_with_xgboost(self, symbol: str) -> str`
  - Returns a mock prediction using an XGBoost model.

### Class: `AIChat`
Provides AI chat functionality about the stock or cryptocurrency.

#### Methods:
- `chat_with_ai(self, symbol: str, question: str) -> str`
  - Returns a mock response from an AI chat for a given question.

### Helper Functions (Optional)

- `mock_data_loader() -> dict`
  - Loads all necessary mock data for the application.

### Integration Notes:
- All classes must be integrated into a cohesive module.
- Consider using dependency injection for ease of testing.
- Focus on creating a seamless interaction between the UI components and the backend logic provided by these classes.

This design outlines a self-contained module with mock data integration that backend developers can further build upon to connect with real data sources.

I have provided all necessary components, methods, and class structures to facilitate the construction of the backend logic as per the requirement. This should be comprehensive enough for the developer to implement effectively.
