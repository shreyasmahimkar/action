# Module Design: accounts.py

The `accounts.py` module forms the core of our web application aimed at providing stock and crypto analysis. Here's a detailed design of the classes and functions defined within this module:

## Class: Account

### Description:
The `Account` class handles user-related functionalities, including login, signup, and user profile management.

### Methods:

- `__init__(self, username: str, password: str, profile_picture: str = '') -> None`
  - Initializes an Account object with a username, password, and an optional profile picture.

- `signup(self, username: str, password: str) -> dict`
  - Simulates user signup and returns a mock user profile.

- `login(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool`
  - Authenticates user login using mock credentials.

- `get_user_profile(self) -> dict`
  - Returns details of the user profile, including the username and profile picture.

## Class: StockCryptoAnalysis

### Description:
Responsible for fetching and processing data about stocks and cryptocurrencies for technical and statistical analysis.

### Methods:

- `fetch_data(self, symbol: str) -> dict`
  - Fetches and returns mocked data for the specified stock/crypto symbol.

- `statistical_analysis(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Performs statistical analysis on the mocked data and returns simplified results.

- `technical_analysis(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Conducts technical analysis using various models on the mocked data and provides insights.

- `time_series_forecast(self, data: dict, days: int = 7) -> dict`
  - Predicts and returns the time series forecast for the next specified number of days.

- `news_fetch(self, symbol: str) -> list`
  - Retrieves a list of mock news articles related to the specified stock/crypto symbol.

## Class: MachineLearningModels

### Description:
Implements machine learning models to predict stock/crypto trends.

### Methods:

- `hidden_markov(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Uses a Hidden Markov Model to predict next state for the data.

- `xgboost_model(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Implements XGBoost for trend prediction.

- `lstm_model(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Applies an LSTM model for stock/crypto prediction.

- `random_forest(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Utilizes Random Forest algorithm for market prediction.

- `gradient_boosting(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Employs Gradient Boosting to forecast market trends.

- `svm_model(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Uses Support Vector Machine for predicting future states.

- `knn_model(self, data: dict) -> dict`
  - Applies K-Nearest Neighbors for prediction.

## Class: UserInterface

### Description:
Handles the layout and user interface components of the web application.

### Methods:

- `render_landing_page(self) -> None`
  - Sets up the UI elements for the landing page including input boxes, forms, and sections for displaying analysis results.

- `render_dashboard(self, user_profile: dict) -> None`
  - Displays the user dashboard with navigation options and user-specific features.

- `render_sidebar(self) -> None`
  - Renders the sidebar with various features and options for user navigation.

- `prompt_ai_features_signup(self) -> None`
  - Prompts the user to sign up or login to access AI-driven features.

## Class: Backtest

### Description:
Conducts backtesting on historical data to evaluate predictions against historical outcomes.

### Methods:

- `run_backtest(self, data: dict, days: int = 30) -> dict`
  - Simulates backtesting for the given data over a specified period.

## Class: AIChat

### Description:
Provides an interactive chat interface between the user and the web application using AI.

### Methods:

- `chat_with_ai(self, message: str) -> str`
  - Allows users to send messages to the AI chatbot and receive responses related to stocks/cryptos.
