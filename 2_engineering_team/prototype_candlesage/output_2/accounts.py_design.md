# Detailed Design for `accounts.py` Python Module

## Overview
The `accounts.py` module is a self-contained Python script designed to handle the backend logic of a web application that provides statistical and technical analysis for stocks and cryptocurrencies. It leverages mockup data for AAPL and Bitcoin and applies machine learning models for predictions. Additionally, the module incorporates user authentication features and operates an interface for interactive exploration of data.

## Module Structure
The module is structured around the `Account` class, which encompasses all the necessary functionalities. Here, we describe the class and functions in detail.

### Account Class

```python
class Account:

    def __init__(self, username: str, password: str):
        """
        Initialize Account with username and password.
        Mock user data and credentials.
        """
        ...

    def login(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool:
        """
        Handle user login functionality with mock credentials.
        Returns True if login is successful, otherwise False.
        """
        ...

    def signup(self, user_data: dict) -> None:
        """
        Handle user signup process, create a mock user profile.
        """
        ...

    def get_statistical_analysis(self, symbol: str) -> dict:
        """
        Retrieve and return mock statistical analysis data for the given symbol.
        :param symbol: Stock or crypto symbol
        :return: Dictionary of statistical analysis metrics
        """
        ...

    def get_technical_analysis(self, symbol: str) -> dict:
        """
        Retrieve and return mock technical analysis data for the given symbol.
        :param symbol: Stock or crypto symbol
        :return: Dictionary of technical analysis data
        """
        ...

    def get_news(self, symbol: str) -> list:
        """
        Retrieve and return mock news items for the given symbol.
        :param symbol: Stock or crypto symbol
        :return: List of news items
        """
        ...

    def forecast_time_series(self, symbol: str) -> list:
        """
        Predict the next 7-day forecast using a mock time series
        model for the given stock/crypto.
        :param symbol: Stock or crypto symbol
        :return: List of forecasted values
        """
        ...

    def hidden_markov_model_prediction(self, symbol: str) -> str:
        """
        Predict the next state of stock/crypto using a Hidden Markov Model.
        :param symbol: Stock or crypto symbol
        :return: Predicted state as a string
        """
        ...

    def xgboost_prediction(self, symbol: str) -> str:
        """
        Predict the next state of stock/crypto using an XGBoost Model.
        :param symbol: Stock or crypto symbol
        :return: Predicted state as a string
        """
        ...

    def backtest(self, symbol: str, days: int) -> dict:
        """
        Perform a backtest on stock/crypto data for the past X days.
        :param symbol: Stock or crypto symbol
        :param days: Number of days for backtesting
        :return: Result of the backtest as a dictionary
        """
        ...

    def ai_chat(self, question: str) -> str:
        """
        Provide an AI chat response based on user queries regarding the 
        stock/crypto.
        :param question: User's chat question
        :return: AI generated response
        """
        ...

    def access_ai_features(self, logged_in: bool) -> str:
        """
        Guide user to access AI features, prompting for login if necessary.
        :param logged_in: Boolean status of login
        :return: String message directing user
        """
        ...
```

## Summary
The module includes functionalities for user authentication, data retrieval, and analysis using both traditional and machine learning methods, all wrapped within the `Account` class. Each method is equipped with parameters and expected return types for clarity. Using mock data sets, users can simulate real-world analysis without persistent storage at this stage. 

This design lays the foundation for a testable backend module that can be integrated into a full-fledged web application, offering a variety of market analysis tools and user interaction capabilities.
